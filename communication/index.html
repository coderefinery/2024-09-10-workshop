          <p>CodeRefinery is teaching good enough FAIR research software development practices in two workshops a year with all open source lesson materials (https://coderefinery.org/lessons/#lessons-that-we-teach-in-our-tools-workshops).</p>
<p>The next iteration will be September 10-12 and 17-19 9-13 CEST (<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/">info and registration on our event page</a>) and we have four ways for YOU to be part of and support it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Advertise to your network; check our <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/communication/">communications page for advertisement texts</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be a learner or observer; register on our <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/">event webpage</a> .</p>

<p>Become a co-instructor for any of our lessons, you will be onboarded and never alone; a nice way to start your teaching journey or expand your teaching horizon :) If this sounds interesting to you, say hi in #<strong>coderefinery-tools-workshop</strong> channel or come to one of our open planning meetings every Monday at 14 CEST:  <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/team-meeting">Connection details on our collaborative document</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Bring your own classroom&quot; - You do not have the capacity to provide a workshop on version control and other FAIR research software development practices yourself, but know your community would need it? -&gt; Provide a space to watch the CodeRefinery workshop together!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We also wrote a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.org/blog/bring-your-own-classroom/">blog post about this model including feedback from previous classrooms</a></p>

          <p>Dear {first_name},</p>
<p>on Tuesday (Oct 22) and the Tuesday the week after (Oct 29) we offer two sessions where you can ask questions about the CodeRefinery workshop material and how to apply it to your own code and scripts and research:
https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/#schedule (bottom of that page)</p>
<p>You can bring your own code and we can look at it together. Or we just discuss any questions that you might have about research software development.</p>
<p>I hope to see you there. This will be on Zoom and not recorded:

<p>We hope you got some good practice and understanding on how to collaborate using Git/GitHub and our trial of collaborating with you from the stream worked out for you! If you have suggestions on how to improve our lessons, please open issues or send pull requests:</p>

</ul>
<p>This week will be a little bit more diverse.</p>
<p>We will take a peek into six topics that are all related to FAIR research software development:</p>
<p>Tuesday will start with an overview of how all CodeRefinery lessons fit together under the umbrella of reproducible research and what steps you can take now already to make your research more reproducible. In the afternoon we will look into licenses, how they work and why you might want to care even when &quot;only writing a small script for myself&quot;.</p>
<p>Wednesday morning we look at different ways of how to document research code. From small projects with good README files to external documentation on Read the Docs. In the afternoon we will show some tips and tricks around Jupyter notebooks and how they can be used also outside of courses.</p>
<p>Thursday we step a little deeper into software development practices by giving you an introduction into automated testing and how this could benefit you and your collaborators. The workshop ends with some live coding to showcase how to make code more reusable by caring about modularity.</p>
<p>In contrast to week 1, there will not be any dedicated exercise times in week 2. Instead, instructors will demo things and discuss with you using the collaborative document. If you want, you can of course try to follow the demos or try to do them on your own time after the workshop. For this, you will need to install some tools which you can find at: https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/.</p>
<p>We hope to see you again this week with the first session starting Tuesday at 9:00 CET (10 EET). We will start the stream 10 minutes earlier: https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/#schedule</p>
<p>As we did last week, you will need at least two browser windows to 1) watch the stream and 2) ask questions:</p>

          <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The 3rd session of the workshop starts in ~1h.
We'll go through <strong>Git collaborative</strong>: we will all work together to make our recipe book. The same book, at the same time!</p>
<p>What you need to do to prepare, if you haven't already:</p>
<p>It is possible to do everything on Github, but it's a good opportunity to work locally, if you have VS Code set up or the command line.
We recommend a team to help here, since we can't help if it's not set up yet. If you have a local team, you can work together instead of contributing to our example repos.</p>
<p>Reminder:</p>
<p>If you would like to <strong>participate as individual learner</strong> in the collaborative exercises, please request access by opening an issue at https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/access-requests/issues/new/choose (There click &quot;Get started&quot; -&gt; &quot;Submit new issue&quot;)</p>
<p>This way we will know your GitHub username and give you write access to exercise repositories.</p>
<p>After we add you as collaborator, you will get an email from GitHub.</p>
<p>Please accept the invitation Don't forget to &quot;unwatch&quot; both https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise and https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise-recorded to make sure you don't get too many emails during the exercise. To &quot;unwatch&quot;, go to the repository and click the &quot;Unwatch&quot; button (top middle of the screen) and then select &quot;Participating and @mentions&quot;.</p>

          <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for joining us today.</p>
<p>You may find the archived questions and answers at https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/questions/.
If you'd like to revisit some of the episodes, you may find the videos on Twitch https://twitch.tv/coderefinery for another week and later today on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/@coderefinery3414/playlists.</p>
<p>Preparations for day 2:</p>
<p>Having the local editors available is good: VS Code or command line. See the second option on installation (https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/). If you don't have these, you can still attend and there are some steps you can do, and you'll learn for the future.</p>
<p>Preparations for day 3:</p>
<p>On Thursday we will all practice how to collaborate using Git/GitHub and one ambitious thing we will try is to collaborate with participants following via stream.</p>
<p>If you would like to participate as individual learner in the collaborative exercises, please request access by opening an issue at https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/access-requests/issues/new/choose (There click &quot;Get started&quot; -&gt; &quot;Submit new issue&quot;)</p>
