CodeRefinery is teaching good enough FAIR research software development practices in two workshops a year with all open source lesson materials (https://coderefinery.org/lessons/#lessons-that-we-teach-in-our-tools-workshops).

The next iteration will be September 10-12 and 17-19 9-13 CEST ([info and registration on our event page]( https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/)) and we have four ways for YOU to be part of and support it:

1. Advertise to your network; check our [communications page for advertisement texts](https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/communication/)

2. Be a learner or observer; register on our [event webpage](https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/) .

3. Become a co-instructor for any of our lessons, you will be onboarded and never alone; a nice way to start your teaching journey or expand your teaching horizon :) If this sounds interesting to you, say hi in #**coderefinery-tools-workshop** channel or come to one of our open planning meetings every Monday at 14 CEST:  [Connection details on our collaborative document](https://hackmd.io/@coderefinery/team-meeting)

4. "Bring your own classroom" - You do not have the capacity to provide a workshop on version control and other FAIR research software development practices yourself, but know your community would need it? -> Provide a space to watch the CodeRefinery workshop together!

We also wrote a [blog post about this model including feedback from previous classrooms](https://coderefinery.org/blog/bring-your-own-classroom/)
