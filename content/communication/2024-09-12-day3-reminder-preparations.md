Hi,

The 3rd session of the workshop starts in ~1h.
We'll go through **Git collaborative**: we will all work together to make our recipe book. The same book, at the same time!

What you need to do to prepare, if you haven't already:

It is possible to do everything on Github, but it's a good opportunity to work locally, if you have VS Code set up or the command line.
We recommend a team to help here, since we can't help if it's not set up yet. If you have a local team, you can work together instead of contributing to our example repos.

Reminder:

If you would like to **participate as individual learner** in the collaborative exercises, please request access by opening an issue at https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/access-requests/issues/new/choose (There click "Get started" -> "Submit new issue")

This way we will know your GitHub username and give you write access to exercise repositories.

After we add you as collaborator, you will get an email from GitHub.

Please accept the invitation Don't forget to "unwatch" both https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise and https://github.com/cr-workshop-exercises/centralized-workflow-exercise-recorded to make sure you don't get too many emails during the exercise. To "unwatch", go to the repository and click the "Unwatch" button (top middle of the screen) and then select "Participating and @mentions".
