Dear {first_name},

on Tuesday (Oct 22) we had the first bring-your-own-code session and it was really fun.

The second session moves to Dec 18:
https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/#schedule (bottom of that page)

You can bring your own code and we can look at it together. Or we just discuss any questions that you might have about research software development.

Please let me know if you would like me to send you a calendar invitation for the Dec 18 session.

on behalf of the CodeRefinery project,

Radovan
