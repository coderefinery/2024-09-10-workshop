Dear {first_name},

on Tuesday (Oct 22) and the Tuesday the week after (Oct 29) we offer two sessions where you can ask questions about the CodeRefinery workshop material and how to apply it to your own code and scripts and research:
https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/#schedule (bottom of that page)

You can bring your own code and we can look at it together. Or we just discuss any questions that you might have about research software development.

I hope to see you there. This will be on Zoom and not recorded:
(zoom link sent to registered participants)

Please don't hesitate to write me if you have any questions about this.

on behalf of the CodeRefinery project,

Radovan
