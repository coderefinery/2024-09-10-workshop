### News

Day 2:

- We covered all of the parts listed in the schedule
- Tomorrow, we begin collaborative: we *all* work together to make our recipe book.  The same book, at the same time!
- What you need to do to prepare
    - It is possible to do everything on Github
    - But it's a good chance to work locally, if you have VS Code set up or command line.  We recommend a team to help here, since we can't help if it's not set up yet.
    - If you have a local team, you *can work together* instead of contributing to our example repos.

Day 1:

- Today, we covered all the lessons as shown on the schedule.
- Tomorrow, we will do many of the same things, but now on our own computers.
- Preparation for day 2: having the local editors available is good:
  VS Code or command line.  See the second option on
  [installation](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/).  If
  you don't have these, you can still attend and there are some steps
  you can do, and you'll learn for the future.
