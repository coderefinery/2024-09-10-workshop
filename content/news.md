### News

Day 1:

- Today, we covered all the lessons as shown on the schedule.
- Tomorrow, we will do many of the same things, but now on our own computers.
- Preparation for day 2: having the local editors available is good:
  VS Code or command line.  See the second option on
  [installation](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/).  If
  you don't have these, you can still attend and there are some steps
  you can do, and you'll learn for the future.
