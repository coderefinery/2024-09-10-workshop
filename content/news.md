### News

Day 3: 
- Today we covered how to contribute to repositories that we are a member of as well as repositories that we were not a member of 
- This concludes  the introduction and collaborative version control lessons and exercises
- Next week we will step away from version control and get to know different tools and techniques that can help you write FAIR code and software such as documentation, licensing, Jupyter, modular code development, automated testing
- There will be demos instead of exercise sessions, but you can do the exercises after the workshop days and use the notes to ask questions, or join our chat: https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com or the "bring your own code sessions" in october; see [schedule](https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-09-10-workshop/#schedule)

Day 2:

- We covered all of the parts listed in the schedule
- Tomorrow, we begin collaborative: we *all* work together to make our recipe book.  The same book, at the same time!
- What you need to do to prepare
    - It is possible to do everything on Github
    - But it's a good chance to work locally, if you have VS Code set up or command line.  We recommend a team to help here, since we can't help if it's not set up yet.
    - If you have a local team, you *can work together* instead of contributing to our example repos.

Day 1:

- Today, we covered all the lessons as shown on the schedule.
- Tomorrow, we will do many of the same things, but now on our own computers.
- Preparation for day 2: having the local editors available is good:
  VS Code or command line.  See the second option on
  [installation](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/).  If
  you don't have these, you can still attend and there are some steps
  you can do, and you'll learn for the future.
