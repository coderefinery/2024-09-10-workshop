## Be a team leader

Do you know some of the topics, but want to review them?
Do you wish your colleagues or friends would use these tools?
Why not [attend as a team leader](@/join.md)?
Gather some friends who want to learn the topics and follow the workshop together.
You don't need to be an expert: if you have been through CodeRefinery once or have some familiarity
with the topics, and you are confident to call an expert helper when needed,
then you have all it takes to lead a team to success,
or lead even more people and join as an organization (see below).

## Be a Q&A helper

Help us answer questions from the participants in the online Q&A document (collaborative notes).


## Partners and local exercise groups

Some partners offer local support, such as breakout rooms, to their local
teams. You can [become a partner](https://coderefinery.org/about/partners/) to
support your community!
